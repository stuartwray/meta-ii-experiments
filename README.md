===================

Building on META-II by Schorre and further developments by Neighbors.

See "Meta-II: A Syntax-Oriented Compiler Writing Language" D. V. Schorre
and "Tutorial: Metacompilers Part 1" by James M. Neighbors.

Neighbors re-implements and extends Schorre's Meta-II compiler. His first 
version closely follows Schorre's original, then with the improved formatting
in his extended version he regenerates that compiler as javascript. This
is what runs the examples in the interactive "Metacompiler Workshop" on his
website.
